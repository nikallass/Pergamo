## [1.3.210] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- Created `SafeLauncher.kt` extension abstraction (`safeLaunch`) to safely launch all `ActivityResultLauncher` intents.
- Centralized `ActivityNotFoundException` error handling with fallback user notifications on devices missing document providers or file managers.
- Added static release versioning architecture using `gradle.properties` as the single source of truth for `APP_VERSION_CODE` and `APP_VERSION_NAME`.

### Fixed
- Fixed potential application crashes caused by unprotected Storage Access Framework (SAF) calls when no `DocumentsUI` or compatible document provider activity is available.
- Hardened image cropping flow (`CropHelper.kt`) against missing target activity exceptions.
- Synchronized F-Droid metadata, GitHub Actions workflows, and Play Store build properties.

### Changed
- Preserved Git release tags permanently in GitHub Action workflows to support F-Droid build reproducibility.
